# START HERE - Fix Complete!

## What Was Wrong

The app had `output: 'export'` in `next.config.js` which **disabled API routes**. This caused the "Unexpected token '<'" error because the app was trying to call API endpoints that didn't exist.

## Fixed!

✅ Removed static export configuration
✅ API routes now work properly
✅ Ready to generate LinkedIn posts

## Next Steps

### 1. Stop the current dev server (if running)
Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal

### 2. Restart the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Get your FREE API key

Choose ONE option:

**Option A: Groq (Faster, Recommended)**
1. Go to: https://console.groq.com/keys
2. Sign up (it's free)
3. Create new API key
4. Copy the key (starts with `gsk_`)

**Option B: Hugging Face**
1. Go to: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Login/Sign up (free)
3. Create new token (Read access)
4. Copy the token (starts with `hf_`)

### 4. Add API key to .env file

Open the `.env` file in your project folder and replace:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

With your actual key:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_abc123xyz...
```

OR if using Hugging Face:

```
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_abc123xyz...
```

### 5. Restart dev server again
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# Start again
npm run dev
```

### 6. Use the app!

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Paste 3-5 of your LinkedIn posts
3. Use format: `1--> Post content 2--> Next post 3--> Another post`
4. Click "Generate New Post Ideas"
5. Copy and post to LinkedIn!

## That's It!

The JSON error is now fixed. Just add your API key and restart the server.
